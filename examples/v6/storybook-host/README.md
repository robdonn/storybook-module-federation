# Storybook host example

This example demos using Storybook as a host application consuming remote components

- `app` is the remote React application
- `storybook` is the Storybook host application

Run `yarn start`. This will build and serve both `app` and `storybook` on ports `8000` and `9000` respectively.

localhost:8000 (REMOTE)
localhost:9000 (STORYBOOK HOST)
